# *Event Driven Architecture*
## *Capital One*
## *Short Project Description*
Current modern financial transaction fulfillment, and banking requires fulfillment in bulk at the end of each business day. This is a constraint that limits the flow of transactions, and results in bottlenecks and untimely business transaction fulfillments due to the monolithic and highly coupled nature of their architecture.

In order to solve this issue, many banking businesses set out to build an event driven, cloud-based system for processing financial transactions. This paradigm processes significant changes in states as events in order to facilitate efficiency and modularity.

We are tasked with creating a small-scale prototype for the Fall semester utilizing Amazon Web Services with the requirements: 1) Create new user accounts 2) Initiate and fulfill transactions. In addition to this, the storing of financial and user information in secure databases must be considered as well as the connection between event producers and consumers in order to improve the overall processing efficiency for financial transactions.


The directory structure in this GitHub is to allow the project to have all its resources self-contained.
Open Source software should not just be a repository of code.  There are a number of directories to help you and others that will 
follow in your foot steps.  It'll also allow the Linux Foundation OMP Mentorship program to keep track of your project and get
a better understanding of the problems you encountered during the developmemnt of this project.
